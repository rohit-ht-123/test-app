Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files over time, enabling developers to collaborate efficiently and manage code history. Unlike centralized systems, each developer has a complete copy of the project, allowing for offline work and robust redundancy. Git organizes changes into commits, which are snapshots of the project at specific points, and uses branches to create parallel versions for feature development or bug fixes. Merging combines these branches, while the staging area prepares changes for commits.
